# Feature_importance
Code for implementing 21 feature importance computation methods. Note that the
Featurewiz and Shapash packages were implemented in a separate Jupyter notebook
and a separate virtual environment that implements an older version of Python (3.7).
At the time of this writing, they were not compatible with Python 3.10.3, which is the Python version used for the remainder of the algorithms.
